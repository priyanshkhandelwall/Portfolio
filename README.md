## 👋 About Me

I’m Priyansh, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Sydney, specialising in data analytics and analytics-driven decision-making.

I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships in data analytics, automation, and backend development, where I worked extensively with Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to clean data, build dashboards, automate workflows, and support business decisions.

This portfolio reflects how I approach analytics work: structured, practical, and focused on impact rather than theory.
